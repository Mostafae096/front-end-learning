# front-end-learning documentation
this a documentation of my journey to learn front-end dev
I started with js with a freecodecamp crash course 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg&t=27s'
and kept going with them for CSS 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTHC78giGQ&t=4221s' but i haven't finished it 
because I decided to learn by doing first so 
I searched for page-dev on YouTube and finished to of them
first on of a shoe company 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXLjWRteuWI&t=1240s'
second one of an app company 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&t=5757s'
from the same channel 'https://www.youtube.com/@DesignCourse'
which still have a lot of videos I wanna check out
and i finished digital clock project from this video 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWv2jnhZErc&t=11495s'
and decided to start writing without videos so I made facebook login page it looks horrible but it gets the job done
and decided to collect all css properties from those projects and make a list of them to continue adding to it
